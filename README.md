# Food Vision Notebook

## Project Overview

This project utilizes deep learning techniques for food image recognition. The model is trained using feature extraction and fine-tuning methodologies with TensorFlow and Keras. The training process involves two main stages:
1. Training on 10% of the dataset to leverage pre-trained model features.
2. Expanding the training to the entire dataset to refine and enhance model performance.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and fine-tuning.
- **Dataset**: Trained on a subset (10%) initially, followed by training on the complete dataset for comprehensive learning.
